Software for Very Rapid Ice Loss Events  

Using downloaded Sea Ice Extent, Sea Ice Concentration, and near-surface wind, we  
-Identify dates of events from high-passed SIE time series and anomalous SIE loss  
-Use changes in SIC to identify connected sea ice loss objects  
-Define a location within the largest SIC object (either by max SIC loss or wind speed)
